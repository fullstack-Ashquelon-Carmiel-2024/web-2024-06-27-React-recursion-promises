Choice between the modes.

Mode1: Machine thinks about a number, we guess

       HTML: Rules: Machine is going to think about a number from 1 to 100,
             you should guess it.

             Show count of trials(it's Math.ceil(Math.log2(200)))
             Input of a number 
             Button for check or input with listener on "change"
             "Start Game" - the listener could be removed till
                             the player guesses the number 
             Output (for machine answers(my num is smaller or my num is greater
                     or you won or you failed) and validation)
             Number to guess - hidden - optional
             What is the maximal number - optional
             Some super-response when we win - optional

Mode2: We think about a number, the machine guesses 

       HTML: Rules: ................

             Three buttons: my number is greater, my number is smaller,
                             you've got it!
             Where the computer shows it's number.
             What is the maximal number - optional
             Some super-response when we win - optional

Our number: 39, we play from 1 to 100

Turn1: min=1, max=100, center = Math.floor((min+max-1)/2) = 50
Our num is smaller

Turn2: min=1, max=center-1=49, center = Math.floor((min+max-1)/2) = 24
Our num is greater

Turn3: min=center+1=25, max=49, center = Math.floor(min+(max-min-1)/2)
                                         Math.floor((min+max-1)/2) = 36
Our num is greater

Turn4: min=center+1=37, max=49, center = Math.floor((min+max-1)/2) = 42
Our num is smaller

Turn5: min=37 max=center-1=41, center = Math.floor((min+max-1)/2) = 38
Our num is greater

Turn6: min=center+1=39, max=41, center = Math.floor((min+max-1)/2) = 39
You've got it!!!!!!!

Mode3: - optional - manage game of person vs person
