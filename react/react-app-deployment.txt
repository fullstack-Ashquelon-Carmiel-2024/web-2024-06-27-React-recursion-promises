1. For example you'd like to upload the homework "Counters"

2. So you create on the hosting directory panda/<your name>/hw-2023-06-23/counters

3. Now you go to your React app package.json and add there
   the entry "homepage", like this:

   {
  "name": "counters",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "homepage": "https://panda.knowledger.guru/natalie/hw-2023-06-23/counters",

4. In the terminal:

   $ cd react/counters

   (if there is no node_modules, run "npm i")

   $ npm run build

5. Now you've got directory "build" 

6. Use FTP client like Filezilla and copy the contents of
   your local "build" dir to "counters" dir on the hosting

7. Now check it in the browser at:

https://panda.knowledger.guru/<your name>/hw-2023-06-23/counters
