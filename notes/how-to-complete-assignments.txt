1. Supposedly you've got "git" installation.
   If not, please download it and install (choose all the defaults,
   don't change nothing through the installation)

2. One of the parts of "git" installation is "git bash" - this is a "bash" shell
   (language) environment, and we're going to use it extensively.

   To open "git bash" - on Mac - you know what to do
                      - on Windows -> go to the "Windows" sign => write "git bash" =>
                          click "open as Administrator"

   Now you see "Git Bash" command line window.

3. You've got an accound on https://github.com site,
   your credentials there your email, your username and your password.

   Now you should update your github credentials on your computer.

   So, in git bash window run the next 2 commands (put there right email
   and right username - if you don't remember your username - get
   to your github.com account, click on your profile picture - the first
   thing you see there - is your username):

   $ git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
   $ git config --global user.name "Your GitHub UserName"

   Like ($ -- is not a part of the command):

   $ git config --global user.email "jane.smith@google.com"
   $ git config --global user.name "JaneSmith125"

4. Click on the link of the homework. It gets you to the GitHub Classroom.
   If you first time in this classroom, choose yourself from the list.
   Now wait a second - the directory (repository) of the homework
   is being copied especially for you.

   Now you've got a link for your copy - click on it and get there.

   There you see a green button "Code", copy from inside https address
   of this repository - you're going to use it to copy it on your computer.

5. Get into "Git Bash" window again.

   Write there the next command

   $ cd "the full path to the directory of our course"

   Like:

   $ cd /c/users/jane/web-course

6. Now we'll use command "clone" that will copy the directory (repository)
   of the homework from GitHub to your computer:

   $ git clone https://github.com/web-Ashquelon-Carmiel-2024-assignments/Web-2024-04-17-addEventListener.git

7. Let's open this dir with VS CODE:

   $ code Web-2024-04-17-addEventListener

8. Now we should move to your local git repository (directory). So we get back
   to the command window of "Git Bash"

   $ cd "Your directory of the assignment"

   like 

   $ cd Web-2024-04-17-addEventListener

9. To check that everything is OK, for example

    $ git status
    On branch main
    Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

    nothing to commit, working tree clean

10. Now you work in VS CODE, add files, perform changes ...
    When you want to write down the changes into git.
    You get to the Command line window and the "git status" will show you that
    now you have changes, for example

    $ git status
    On branch main
    Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

    Changes not staged for commit:
    (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
    (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
            modified:   index.html
            modified:   style.css

11. To add the changes to git perform two next commands
    $ git add *

    $ git commit -m"first changes"

    Instead of "first changes" you could put any comment

12. You could work more and perform the action 11. from time to time

    When you want to show your changes in GitHub you perform

    $ git push

    This one you could perform any amount of times too


13. If you want to unite all the 3 commands into one:

$ git add * && git commit -m"added New.html" && git push

And use Arrow Up or Down to get to the command again
