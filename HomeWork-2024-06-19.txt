1. In parallel with our project Yummy 
   finish your own project 
   08-NodeJS-SQL-Your-Theme - 
   deploy it to the hosting.
   Use Cookbook002 last steps.
   This project is getting evaluated for the theme of 
   "Basic NodeJS Express MVC CRUD API"

2. Finish the project STRING GAMES - code the last 
   part of it: "words in word" game - see
   the explanation in the "projects" dir.  

3. Callbacks and asynchronous.
   To run in a browser.

  Order a Book
  -------------------------- 
   i) Create an asynchronous function orderBook(author,bookName,callback) that 
   gets author name, bookname and callback as parameters.

   It should show:
     "Thanks, we've got your order of <book name> by <author name>"

   After that it should run setTimeout() for 1000 msec and show
   after that:
     "We're starting to prepare your order ..."

   After that it should run another setTimeout for 2000msec and
   inside it's callback create the message:

   let msg=`The order of ${bookName} by ${author} is ready`

   and also inside run the callback that the function orderBook() got,
   with an argument of the message (callback(msg)).

   ii) Create 2 functions that can be used as callbacks for orderBook()
   function.

      1st. showInConsole(message) - shows the message in the console 
      2nd. showAlert(message) - shows the message with alert()

   iii) Run orderBook() twice - first time pass it
                showInConsole as a third argument,
            and for the second time pass it showAlert as a third argument


4. Create recursive function sumFrom1TillN(n) 
   it should find sum 1 + 2 + 3 ... + n

5. React training - only for those who want:

   Create React app like we did in first-app.
   But now it should show for sell phones (for now the same, like we did).
   Also add 'Header' component and use it to show the name of the store.
   Take Cookbook03 to help yourself.
